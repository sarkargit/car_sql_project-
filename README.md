### Project: **Car Inventory Management System**

#### **Project Overview:**
The Car Inventory Management System is designed to track and analyze data about various cars, including details such as the year of manufacture, fuel type, and other specifications. The system allows users to efficiently query and retrieve information regarding the total number of cars, cars available in specific years, fuel types, and other key data points. The purpose of this system is to provide insights into the car inventory, helping businesses make data-driven decisions based on year-wise availability, fuel type distribution, and trends over time.

#### **Key Features:**
1. **Car Data Retrieval**  
   The system can retrieve all records from the `car` table, displaying details about every car in the inventory.
   
2. **Year-Based Car Count**  
   Users can determine the number of cars available in any given year, with specific queries for years like 2020, 2021, and 2022, helping track trends in car availability.

3. **Fuel Type Distribution**  
   The system provides the ability to analyze the distribution of fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, CNG) across various years, offering insights into the types of cars that are most common in each period.

4. **Data Analysis Across Multiple Years**  
   Detailed queries can be executed to analyze car availability from 2015 to 2023, allowing businesses to observe changes in inventory over several years and potentially forecast future trends.

5. **Advanced Data Grouping**  
   The system supports advanced queries that group data by year and fuel type, allowing for in-depth analysis and reporting on car distributions over time.

6. **Identification of Popular Years**  
   The project includes a feature to identify years with more than 100 cars in the inventory, highlighting years with significant inventory availability for targeted marketing or stock management.

#### **Technology Stack:**
- **Database Management System (DBMS):** SQL (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- **Data Structure:** Relational Database (using tables such as `car`, etc.)
- **Key SQL Queries:** Data aggregation (counting, grouping), filtering by year and fuel type, and advanced selection based on specific conditions.

#### **Potential Use Cases:**
- **Inventory Management:** Track and manage car stock over time.
- **Market Analysis:** Understand which types of cars (by year and fuel type) are most popular in the inventory.
- **Sales Strategy:** Identify trends in car availability to adjust sales and procurement strategies.
- **Business Insights:** Provide managers with insights into the age and fuel distribution of cars in stock, helping them make informed decisions on restocking, discontinuing, or promoting certain models.
